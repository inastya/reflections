What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A directory becomes a repository. The repo is created no commit is automatically made. It creates hidden .git folder to keep all the git logs.
When I run git init git starts tracking changes of the folders and enables me to do commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It allows me to choose which changes in which files to commit. It is different from repo because it contains the current changes made from the checked out commit. And it is different from the working directory because it is from git’s side.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I can make sure all changes are committed before starting working on a new logical change. Then, I can add files that are a part of 1 logical change to the staging area once they are modified to work with the recent change. Once all the files that my change is touching are changed and add to staging area I can commit.
