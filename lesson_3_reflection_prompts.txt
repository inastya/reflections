When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with others, to access my work from another computer or to show my work to the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   So that I can decide when to pull if the commits made are meaningful. Also I can decide to work on my branch whilst somebody else is updating their branch. I can pull their branch when they are finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of other peoplesâ€™ repos pointing back to originals, clones are copies of repos locally or online, branches are variations of the same code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If the last fetched copy of the origin/master is stored locally, it can be then compared with the changes done on the online version and local version of the same master branch tip.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use a messenger or/and emails to notify people when the code gets updated, I would store the code in a cloud so that others have access to it. It would be easier, since it does not require pushing/pulling and keeping track of the checked out branches etc but it would be harder to recover the versions of the files that were there prior to modifications or to see what changes were introduced and by whom.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
